# langGraph
This is an application that displays the similarity distances between languages graphically.

The project is still in its rudimentary stages, but it will focus on determining the similarity of languages. For instance, using this tool, we should be able to determine the similarity between languages such as English and French, and also determine which words were adopted from one language to another. 

This project is particularly interesting for analyzing languages that may have recently (about 500 years) evolved into multiple languages. It should be capable of determining how close the new languages are, and what we can learn from them about the earlier language. 

Currently, the idea is being conceptualized, but it will be written primarily in python. We will also make use of data science and machine learning technologies.
